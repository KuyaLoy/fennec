          <p>
            Any disputes emerging out of or relating to these Terms, the Site,
            the Items, or the FFRC NFTs shall be resolved on an individual
            basis. You expressly waive any right to participate in a class

          </p>
          <h3>Limited Rights: NFTs and NFT Media</h3>
          <p>
            NFTs are digital tokens minted on the blockchain. Your ownership
            rights and license regarding any of the FFRC NFTs are outlined in
            the “Granting of License” section. The media linked to the FFRC NFTs
            (the “NFT Media”) represents the image file and other related
            information that is linked to a particular FFRC NFT. Your rights
            regarding the NFT Media are outlined in the “Granting of License”
            section.
          </p>
          <h3>Limited Rights: NFTs and NFT Media</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>NFT Media Personal License:</span> By owning an FFRC NFT, we
              grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
              use the NFT Media for personal, non-commercial purposes. This
              license allows you to display, reproduce, and distribute the NFT
              Media solely in connection with your ownership of the FFRC NFT.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>NFT Media Commercial License:</span> Any utilization of the
              NFT Media, including but not limited to its sale, reproduction,
              distribution, or exploitation for financial gain, business
              purposes, or other commercial uses, requires explicit written
              consent from us prior to engagement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>No Rights to Trademarks:</span> These Terms do not grant you
              any right, title, or interest in or to the trademarks, logos, or
              other intellectual property of the FFRC NFTs and the NFT Media.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Third-party Content:</span> Certain logos, images, and other
              materials displayed on the Site or the NFT Media may be owned by
              third parties. You acknowledge that we do not own or control such
              content, and you are solely responsible for obtaining any
              necessary permissions or licenses to use third-party content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Additional Restrictions:</span> You agree not to use the
              FFRC NFT or the NFT Media in any way that is unlawful, fraudulent,
              libelous, defamatory, disparaging, or otherwise violates these
              Terms or applicable laws and regulations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Transfer of License</h3>
          <p>
            If you transfer ownership of an FFRC NFT to another user, the
            license to use the NFT Media will automatically transfer to the new
            owner, subject to these Terms.
          </p>
          <h3>Network Splits and Errors</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Network Splits:</span> If the Ethereum blockchain undergoes
              a network split with a fundamental change (referred to as “fork”),
              resulting in the creation of a new blockchain based on the
              original one, the license granted to you under these Terms will
              only apply to the FFRC NFTs on the new blockchain unless stated
              otherwise on the Site.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Network Errors: </span>In the event of any technical error
              or issue on the Ethereum blockchain that affects the FFRC NFTs, we
              reserve the right to address such issues by recreating new FFRC
              NFTs or any other measure deemed necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Additional Provisions</h3>

            </li>
            <li>

              additional products or services that are separate from the FFRC
              NFTs. Your use of such products or services will be subject to
              these Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Launch Dates:</span> All dates referring to the launch of a
              service or a product on the Site, expressed or implied, are
